    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved developing a simulation of an anthill using object-oriented programming principles in C++. The simulation models the behavior of ants within an anthill, including their interactions and environmental factors.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Object-oriented design to model ants and their environment</li>
      <li>Simulation of ant behavior and interactions</li>
      <li>Graphical representation of the anthill and ant movements using gtkmm3</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>C++:</strong> Core logic and algorithm design</li>
      <li><strong>gtkmm3:</strong> For user interface</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The resulting app is capable of simulating an anthill environment where ants can interact, move, and kill each other based on predefined rules. 
      The simulation provides a visual representation of the ant movements and behaviors, allowing for analysis of their interactions within the anthill.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Future improvements include optimization of the simulation and the addition of more complex ant behaviors and environmental factors.
