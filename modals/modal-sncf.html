    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved developing an intelligent algorithm to compute the shortest path between two railway stations on a map. The project was completed in a simulated environment using ROS and Python, with the aid of visual and spatial data.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Parsed a graph of stations and routes from map data</li>
      <li>Implemented Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms for path planning</li>
      <li>Integrated ROS for real-time simulation of the navigation system</li>
      <li>Used camera feeds for potential station detection (CV integration)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python:</strong> Core logic and algorithm design</li>
      <li><strong>ROS (Robot Operating System):</strong> Simulation environment and real-time communication</li>
      <li><strong>OpenCV:</strong> For future integration with real-world station detection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The resulting system is capable of dynamically computing optimal paths through a network of stations, with potential applications in logistics, rail automation, and drone-based monitoring systems.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Future improvements include real-world data integration, enhanced obstacle avoidance, and deploying the model on an embedded system for field testing.
