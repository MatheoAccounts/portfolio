    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved developing an intelligent algorithm to compute the shortest path between two railway stations on a map. 
      The project was completed using SNCF Open Data and involved parsing station and route data to create a navigable graph. 
      The algorithm was implemented in Python, utilizing Dijkstra’s algorithms with early termination for efficient pathfinding.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Parsed a graph of stations and routes from map data</li>
      <li>Implemented Dijkstra’s algorithms with early termination for path planning</li>
      <li>Used an API and a frontend and made use of GET requests</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python:</strong> Core logic and algorithm design</li>
      <li><strong>Steamlit:</strong> For frontend</li>
      <li><strong>FastAPI:</strong> For backend</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The resulting app is capable of dynamically computing optimal paths through a network of stations, with potential applications in ticket sales and railway traffic optimization.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Future improvements include dynamic ticketing data integration, even better optimization, and making the system publically available.
