    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved developing a computer vision and path planning system for a drone. The goal was to detect the position of the gates and optimize the drone's path to navigate through them efficiently.
      The project utilized Python for the implementation and included real-life testing of the drone's navigation capabilities.
