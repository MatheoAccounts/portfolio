    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project focused on developing a model predictive control (MPC) for a car to navigate a road with another vehicle.
       Various MPC techniques were explored, including linear MPC, nonlinear MPC, robust tube MPC, and LQR.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>MPC to control a car</li>
      <li>Auto speed adjusting, car passing, and car following</li>
      <li>MPC theory such as terminal sets and robust invariant sets used to have robust and stable control</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Maltab:</strong> Core logic and algorithm design</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The resulting MPC is capable of controlling the car so that it can either follow, avoid, or pass the car in front of it.
