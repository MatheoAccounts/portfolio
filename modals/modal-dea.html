    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved the characterization and control of a new type of DEA (Dielectric Elastomer Actuator). 
      characterization was done using system identification techniques, and control was implemented using both reinforcement learning and PID.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>DEA characterization using a custom-made test bench, and then modeled the system using Supervised Learning on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</li>
      <li>Different control using self-sensing were investigated such as PID and Reinforcement Learning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python:</strong> Core logic and algorithm design</li>
      <li><strong>Oscilloscope and DAQ:</strong> For testing and system identification</li>
      <li><strong>Pytorch:</strong> For Reinforcement Learning and RNN</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The project resulted in showing that the capacitive sensing of the DEA changed too much with the voltage applied to the DEA, making it complex to use for control.
      However, the system identification and control techniques developed can be applied to other types of actuators.
